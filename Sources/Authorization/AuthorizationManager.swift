///
/// This generic class manages the app's authorization status for accessing the device's music library.
/// The type parameter `T` specifies the underlying media library implementation (typically `MPMediaLibrary`).
/// It uses the provided media library type to handle authorization requests.
///
/// ## Generic Parameter
/// - `T`: The media library type conforming to `MediaLibraryProtocol` (e.g., `MPMediaLibrary`)
///
/// ## Instantiation
/// Use the `.live` factory property to get the default implementation:
/// ```swift
/// let manager: any AuthorizationManagerProtocol = .live
/// try await manager.authorize()  // Request authorization if needed
/// ```
///
/// For custom implementations, conform to ``AuthorizationManagerProtocol`` and inject your implementation.

    ///
    /// Checks if authorization is already granted. If so, returns immediately.
    /// Otherwise, presents the system authorization dialog to the user.
    ///
    /// - Returns: `.authorized` if permission is granted
    /// - Throws: ``AuthorizationManagerError/unauthorized(_:)`` if access is denied
